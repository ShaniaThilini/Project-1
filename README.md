# Project-1 Automotive data set. 

For this project, I looked into how mileage and condition affect car selling prices using a dataset of used vehicles.

Scatter Plot: Mileage vs. Selling Price
The scatter plot showed that cars with higher mileage tend to sell for less—no surprise there! But, there were some cars that didn’t follow this pattern, which could mean that factors like brand, model, or special features play a role in pricing.

Line Graph: Condition vs. Average Selling Price
The line graph revealed that cars in better condition (closer to 10) generally have higher selling prices. However, there were some fluctuations at lower condition levels, likely due to pricing inconsistencies or outliers.

Takeaways
Both mileage and condition matter a lot when it comes to pricing. Cars with lower mileage and better condition sell for more, which makes sense. This analysis gives useful insights for anyone buying or selling a used car—condition and mileage are two big things to consider when setting a price

# Coding techniques used
I used Pandas for cleaning and organizing the data, like removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting data types. Matplotlib was used for visualizing trends—creating a scatter plot for mileage vs. price and a line graph for condition vs. price. I also used datetime conversion to format dates correctly and grouping/filtering to analyze pricing trends. These tools helped me find key insights on how mileage and condition impact car prices.
